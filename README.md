## Checkpoint 1

For the first checkpoint:

- We created a Lexer that identifies all of the specified tokens
- We created the parser that check the order of the specified tokens to verify the correct syntax

## Checkpoint 2

For this second checkpoint:

- We defined and implemented our semantic cube with all rules on operators and types.
- We defined and created our function tables and the variable tables implemented in TS.

## Checkpoint 3

For this third checkpoint:

- We added embedded semantic actions on our parser that allow us to extract and manipulate context such as variables and functions.
- We defined our virtual memory scheme and structure for the stacks needed for expressions.
